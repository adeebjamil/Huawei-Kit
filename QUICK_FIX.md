# Quick Fix for Vercel Deployment Issues

## Immediate Actions Taken:

### 1. Removed Conflicting CSP Headers
- ❌ Removed CSP from `vercel.json` (was conflicting)
- ❌ Removed CSP from `middleware.ts` (was conflicting)  
- ✅ Added single CSP source in `next.config.ts` with environment-based rules

### 2. Updated CSP Policy
- **Production**: More restrictive but allows necessary Vercel domains
- **Development**: Very permissive for debugging

### 3. Environment Variable Check
Make sure in Vercel dashboard you have:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://websitedata0102_db_user:roygU3jcJBPOWfH4@huaweiekit.ascs3fq.mongodb.net/Huawei-ekit?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=huaweiekit
```

## Deploy Commands:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove conflicting CSP headers and fix Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Test After Deployment:
1. Check console for CSP errors (should be gone)
2. Test admin login: https://huawei-kit.vercel.app/admin
3. Check API health: https://huawei-kit.vercel.app/api/health

## If Still Issues:
1. Check Vercel function logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Test with completely disabled CSP temporarily

The main issue was multiple CSP sources creating conflicts. Now there's only one source with proper Vercel compatibility.
